# AI & ML Code Assistant

This repository contains a Python-based AI assistant application for generating and explaining code related to machine learning, AI, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). It leverages OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- Generates optimized code for complex AI, ML, DL, and NLP tasks.
- Supports dynamic prompts tailored to the user's requirements.
- Integrates LangChain tools for enhanced task execution.
- Streamlit-powered web interface for seamless interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:
   Replace the placeholder in the code with your OpenAI API key or set it as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Open the web app in your browser at the displayed URL.

3. Provide a task description in the input field. Examples:
   - "Generate code for a deep learning model to classify images."
   - "Explain the concept of transformers in NLP with code."

4. The application will generate code and explanations tailored to the provided task description.

## Customization

### Prompt Template
You can modify the `PromptTemplate` in the code to suit specific requirements:
```python
ml_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["task_description"],
    template=("...")
)
```

### Adding Tools
To extend the functionality, integrate more tools using LangChain's `tool` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- OpenAI SDK
- LangChain
